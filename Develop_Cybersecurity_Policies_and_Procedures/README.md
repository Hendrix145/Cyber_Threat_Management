ACME Healthcare is a healthcare company that runs over 25 medical facilities including patient care, diagnostics, outpatient care, and emergency care. The organization has experienced several data breaches over the last five years. These data breaches have cost the organization financially and damaged its reputation.

The executive leadership team recently hired a new chief information security officer (CISO). The new CISO has brought in one of the top cybersecurity penetration teams to perform a full security audit on the entire organization. This independent contractor conducted the audit, and found the following vulnerabilities:

1)    Several accounts were identified for employees that are no longer employed by ACME.

2)    Several user accounts allowed unauthorized and escalated privileges. These accounts accessed systems and information without formal authorization.

3)    Several devices and systems allowed unsecure remote access.

4)    Forty percent of all organization passwords audited were cracked within 6 hours.

5)    Password expiration was not standardized.

6)    Sensitive files were found unencrypted on user devices.

7)    Several wireless hotspots used WEP for encryption and authentication.

8)    Evidence indicates that sensitive e-mail was sent to and from employee homes and mobile devices without encryption.

9)    Intrusion detection logs were infrequently reviewed and analyzed.

10)  Devices with sensitive company data were used by employees for private use.

11)  Employee devices were left unattended and employees failed to logout of the company network and data systems.

12)  Inconsistent device updates and configurations were performed.

13)  Several firewall rules were set to permit all traffic unless specifically denied.

14)  Company servers were not updated with the latest patches.

15)  The intranet web server allowed users to change personal information about themselves, including contact information.
